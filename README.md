# Neural Model Checking — Artefacts and Benchmarks

This repository hosts the artefacts for our NeurIPS 2024 and NeurIPS 2025 papers on Neural Model Checking, along with the combined benchmark set.
Each artefact includes its own detailed, artefact-specific README with setup, reproduction steps, and expected outputs.

## Contents

* **NeurIPS 2024 artefact:** *Neural Model Checking*
* **NeurIPS 2025 artefact:** *Let a Neural Network be Your Invariant*
* **Combined benchmark set:** Extended benchmark set (circuit design only)
